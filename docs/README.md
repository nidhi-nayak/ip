# Welcome to Lovie's User Guide!

## Current Features

### Add a Task

A user can add a task to their task list (generated by Lovie) simply by typing whatever needs to be done.
Lovie will automatically add the task!

### List my Task List

By submitting the command "list", users can access their fully compiled list, with tasks listed numerically
in the order they submitted them. It will additionally represent their completion mark, blank if incomplete
(ie [ ]) and with a checkmark if complete ([✓])

Example:

    1. [ ] cook

    2. [ ] clean

    3. [✓] read

### Mark a Task as Done

A user can mark a task done by using the key word "mark" and the number of the task they would like to mark as
complete. Refer to the example below:

mark 3
